# Installation 

## Prerequisites

**Package Manager: uv**

Serena is managed by `uv`.
If you do not have it yet, install it following the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

**Language-Specific Requirements**

When using the language server backend, some additional dependencies may need to be installed 
to support certain languages.
See the [Language Support](language-servers) page for the list of supported languages.
Many dependencies are installed by Serena on the fly, but if a language requires dependencies 
to be provided manually, this is mentioned in the notes below the respective language.
